    title={A fast local descriptor for dense matching}, 
    year={2008},

    pages={1-8}, 
    abstract={We introduce a novel local image descriptor designed for
        dense wide-baseline matching purposes. We feed our descriptors to a
            graph-cuts based dense depth map estimation algorithm and this yields
            better wide-baseline performance than the commonly used correlation
            windows for which the size is hard to tune. As a result, unlike
            competing techniques that require many high-resolution images to produce
            good reconstructions, our descriptor can compute them from pairs of
            low-quality images such as the ones captured by video streams. Our
            descriptor is inspired from earlier ones such as SIFT and GLOH but
            can be computed much faster for our purposes. Unlike SURF which can
            also be computed efficiently at every pixel, it does not introduce
            artifacts that degrade the matching performance. Our approach was
            tested with ground truth laser scanned depth maps as well as on a wide
            variety of image pairs of different resolutions and we show that good
            reconstructions are achieved even with only two low quality images.},

    abstract={Stable local feature detection and representation is a fundamental
        component of many image registration and object recognition algorithms.
            Mikolajczyk and Schmid (June 2003) recently evaluated a variety of
            approaches and identified the SIFT [D. G. Lowe, 1999] algorithm as
            being the most resistant to common image deformations. This paper
            examines (and improves upon) the local image descriptor used by
            SIFT. Like SIFT, our descriptors encode the salient aspects of the
            image gradient in the feature point's neighborhood; however, instead
            of using SIFT's smoothed weighted histograms, we apply principal
            components analysis (PCA) to the normalized gradient patch. Our
            experiments demonstrate that the PCA-based local descriptors are
            more distinctive, more robust to image deformations, and more
            compact than the standard SIFT representation. We also present
            results showing that using these descriptors in an image retrieval
            application results in increased accuracy and faster matching.},
