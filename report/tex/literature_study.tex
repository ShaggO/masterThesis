\section{Related work}
The different feature descriptors and their algorithms have been constructed
based on different requirements with respect to the use of storage and
computations. \cite{heinly2012comparative} has described the overall field of
descriptors using these two ``variables'' resulting in the following taxonomy:
real value parametrization (high storage and computation), patch-based (high
storage and low computation), binarized (low storage and high computation),
and binary (low storage and computation). We are mainly interested
in the best performance and hence we will focus on the class of real value
parametrization descriptors.
This class of descriptors was revolutionized by \cite{lowe2004distinctive}
which inspired many later descriptors. We will summarize the most successful
of these. The descriptors are furthermore divided into two categories:
gradient-based and higher order descriptors. We also look at various
performance evaluations of descriptors.

\subsection{Gradient-based descriptors}
Gradients of an image are often used to describe features.
The \emph{scale-invariant feature transform} (SIFT) descriptor
\cite{lowe2004distinctive} is the most popular descriptor based on this
approach. It works by dividing the image regions surrounding interest
points into square cells and constructing a histogram of unsigned gradient
orientations for the pixels in each cell. The interest points are detected
using a multi-scale DoG detector. By computing the gradient orientations
at detection scale, the descriptor becomes scale invariant. The descriptor
is also rotation invariant as the cell grid is rotated according to the
dominating gradient orientation. Finally the descriptor achieves illumination
invariance by normalizing the histograms.

PCA-SIFT \cite{ke2004pca} is also based on combining oriented gradients
within a region, but instead of dividing the feature into cell histograms
it uses \emph{principal component analysis} (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality
of the combined gradients. It also uses a multi-scale DoG detector for
interest point detection. PCA computes the most significant linearly independent dimensions of a dataset, and discards the rest. This means that while SIFT is a general purpose descriptor, PCA-SIFT must first be trained on specific data. In order to obtain good results a large and diverse training dataset of images is required. The size of a PCA-SIFT descriptor is substantially lower than SIFT and the other following gradient-based descriptors.

The \emph{gradient location and orientation histogram} (GLOH) descriptor
\cite{mikolajczyk2005performance} is a different extension of the SIFT descriptor.
It differs from SIFT by using a log-polar grid of ring segment cells instead of rectangular cells. The dimensionality of the descriptor is like PCA-SIFT also reduced using PCA, but the analysis is performed on the gradient orientation histograms instead rather than the raw gradients.

The DAISY descriptor \cite{tola2008fast} is a descriptor originally
developed for dense wide-baseline matching, and it is therefore developed
to create a descriptor of each pixel in an image very efficiently. The
descriptor is created from Gaussian directional derivative convolutions of
the image, computed at points located in a circular grid resembling a daisy. The directional derivatives are similar to the histogram bins of SIFT, but can be computed much faster. Further refinements of the algorithm and experiments with the actual layout of the daisy formation have been examined in \cite{winder2009picking}, in which the DAISY descriptor is claimed to perform better than SIFT when used on the image correspondence problem.

The \emph{Histograms of Oriented Gradient} (HOG) descriptor is another alternative to SIFT proposed in \cite{dalal2005histograms} for the purpose of pedestrian detection. Rather than using a detector, the whole image is divided into a dense grid of cells, in which histograms of oriented gradients are computed. Adjacent cells are then grouped together into blocks, which are normalized to accommodate for local illumination changes. HOG descriptors consist of one or more of these blocks. HOG works directly on RGB images by computing the gradients for each colour channel and picking the gradient with the highest magnitude for each pixel. Parts models using the HOG descriptor have been developed \cite{felzenszwalb2008discriminatively} in order to improve upon the accuracy of object detection.

\subsection{Higher order differential descriptors}

Another approach to descriptor design is to use higher order differential
information.
We use the term \emph{local $k$-jet} to refer to a vector
consisting of differential information up to order $k$ at some point.

\emph{Stability based similarity measure} (SBSM) \cite{balmashnova2008novel} for
matching of higher order differential information descriptors
Crosier and Griffin \cite{crosier2010using} base their texture representation, which
is just a descriptor but used for textures, on the local $2$-jet. They
partition the jet space into six Basic Image Features (BIFs) and compute these
across a region of pixels at four different scales. The chosen BIFs are
distinct texture elements such as dark spots and bright lines. Rather than
computing the distribution of BIFs at each scale, the four BIFs at each point
are combined into a BIF-column, and a histogram over all possible
BIF-columns is computed. The descriptors are used for texture classification.

\cite{larsen2012jet} have had success using local 4-jets. Their
$\mathcal{J}_4$-grid2 descriptor is computed from local 4-jets at four points
spread out across a pixel region. A whitening process is used on the jet
coefficients to scale normalize and decorrelate the descriptors, allowing for
Euclidean distance as a distance measure. The descriptor was evaluated against
state of the art on the image correspondence problem and performed favourably,
despite the simplicity of the descriptor.

Another recent higher order descriptor is the galaxy descriptor from Pedersen
et al.\cite{pedersen2013shape}, which is used to predict star-formation
rate from galaxy texture. The descriptor consists of multi-scale histograms
of gradient orientation as well as shape index, which is a simple 1D
representation of second order differential information. The histograms are
computed over a single region at eight scale levels.
