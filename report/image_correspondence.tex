\chapter{Image correspondence}

In this chapter we explain the image correspondence problem and the application of our descriptor to solve the problem.

The image correspondence problem is the problem of matching features across two images $A$ and $B$ of the same object. A match should ideally indicate that the two features correspond to the same physical point or object. The two images of the object can be captured under different lighting conditions, taken from different positions, and have varying tilt, rotation, zoom, and focus; hence the images will differ based on these variables. By using an interest point detector in combination with a descriptor, we are able to find interest points in $A$ and $B$, describe each interest point with a descriptor algorithm, and compare these descriptors across the two images by a given similarity measure to estimate whether the points match.

\section{Matching strategies}
\label{sec:matching_strategies}

The matching performance depends on the matching strategy. \citet{mikolajczyk2005performance} described the following three matching strategies that are used when solving the image correspondence problem:
Simple \emph{thresholding} compares each descriptor in image $A$ with each descriptor in image $B$. Any two descriptors having a mutual distance below a threshold $t$ are classified as matches (positive). \emph{Best-thresholding} finds the best matching descriptor in $B$ for each descriptor in $A$. If the distance is below a threshold $t$, it is a match (positive), and otherwise it is rejected (negative). \emph{Ratio-thresholding} finds the two best matching descriptors in $B$ with distances $B_1$ and $B_2$ for each descriptor in $A$. If the ratio between the two distances ($\frac{B_1}{B_2}$) to the descriptor in $A$ is below a threshold $t$, it is a match (positive). Otherwise the match is rejected (negative). In other words a distance ratio close to 0 is a good match.

We choose the ratio-thresholding strategy since this is the one favoured in previous image correspondence evaluations \cite{mikolajczyk2005performance,dahl2011finding,larsen2012jet,lowe2004distinctive}. Additionally this matching strategy is more general since it uses the ratio between the distance to the two best matching features instead of the absolute values giving less dependence on the descriptor in question. The two following cases give a good rationale for choosing this matching strategy: The first case is when two descriptors are good matches. In this case the descriptors will be very similar, and their difference could be caused by noise or other small variations. Due to this fact the algorithm shouldn't choose one over the other and hence the matching is negative since the distance ratio is close to 1. The second case is when only poorly matching descriptors are present. In this case the distance to both of the best matching descriptors will be high and the distance ratio close to 1 giving us a negative match as desired.


\section{Similarity measure}
\label{sec:similarity_measure}
We need a similarity measure in order to compute the distance between two descriptors. The Euclidean distance is widely used as similarity measure in the literature \cite{lowe2004distinctive,ke2004pca,mikolajczyk2005performance}. \citet{larsen2012in} evaluated the following different similarity measures: $L_1$ distance, Euclidean distance, $\chi^2$ distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Jensen-Shannon divergence, and he found no notable difference in performance for his locally orderless-based descriptor. Based on this and some preliminary tests of our descriptor, where Euclidean distance ($L_2$) slightly outperformed $L_1$-distance, we choose to use Euclidean distance.

\section{Performance measures}
\label{sec:performance_measures}

Having established the matching strategy and similarity measure, we now describe the two performance measures which we use for evaluation of descriptor algorithms.

Assume that we have computed the descriptor distances, found the two best matching descriptors in $B$ for each descriptor in $A$ and computed their distance ratio. We now wish to compute the performance of the descriptor algorithm utilized. By choosing a threshold $t$, we are able to classify the matches as either positives or negatives (binary classification). Reference to method section about ROC/PR. Furthermore the \ROC AUC can be interpreted as the probability that a condition positive match has a lower distance ratio than a condition negative match. These two measures are our final performance measures that we will use for evaluating performance of a descriptor on the image correspondence problem. The approach is similar to that of \citet{winder2009picking,dahl2011finding}.

\section{Dataset}
The dataset we use for training and evaluation of our descriptor is called the DTU Robot 3D dataset \cite{aanaes2010recall} (from now on called the DTU dataset). It consists of images of objects taken in a closed black box with varying illumination using 19 fixed position LED lights. In total there are 60 scenes with varying objects. \Cref{fig:dtu_examples} shows 4 example scenes. \citet{aanaes2010ground} classify the scenes into categories as shown in \Cref{tbl:dtu_scene_classifications}.

The camera is positioned around each scene using an industrial robot arm, which has automatically captured each scene from 119 positions. These positions are defined from a fixed frontal view varying the viewpoint $\theta$ in three arcs at different distance $d$ to the scene. Arc 1 has $d = \SI{0.5}{\meter}$ to the scene and $\theta$ spans $\SI{\pm40}{\degree}$, arc 2 has $d = \SI{0.65}{\meter}$ and $\theta$ spans $\SI{\pm25}{\degree}$, and arc 3 has $d = \SI{0.8}{\meter}$ and $\theta$ spans $\SI{\pm20}{\degree}$. Furthermore a linear path is captured by moving the camera away from the scene, which corresponds to zooming or scaling the scene. This is done at $\theta = \SI{0}{\degree}$ and $d$ spans $[\SI{0.5}{\meter};\SI{0.8}{\meter} ]$. At each of the 119 camera positions 19 individual images $I_i$ are taken with each of the LED lights $i,~\text{for}~i = 1,\hdots,19$ turned on. Using the given camera positions we get four camera paths: three arc paths and one linear path. \Cref{fig:dtu_overview} shows an overview of the four camera paths just described. When computing the performance across the paths we wish to solve the image correspondence problem for matching each image in each path with the \emph{keyframe} image (middle position on arc 1), since this gives us the performance when varying the viewing angle and scale in a structured manner.

	\label{fig:dtu_overview}
\end{figure}

The choice of capturing the scenes with individual LED lights created images with a high amount of cast shadows. \citet{larsen2012jet} created a set\footnote{dataset available at http://roboimagedata.imm.dtu.dk/data/condensed.tar.gz} of artificial diffuse and light paths from the individual LED images which we now briefly explain. The artificial diffuse light images are created from the individual lightings in order to only evaluate the performance of our descriptor under viewpoint changes and to get more natural images. These diffuse images are created by averaging over the individual light images for each camera position:
\begin{align}
	I_{\text{diffuse}} = \frac{1}{19} \sum_{i = 1}^{19} I_{i}
\end{align}
Since the dataset consists of individual LED images, one is able to construct images simulating two light source paths going from right to left and back to front respectively.
Given a light position ${\boldsymbol{x}}$ in the spatial domain of the LED positions, the image $I_{\boldsymbol{x}}$ is constructed by weighting each LED image by the Gaussian of the distance to ${\boldsymbol{x}}$:
\begin{align}
	I_{x} = \sum_{i = 1}^{19} G(\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{x}_i,\sigma) I_{i}
\end{align}
In order to get a somewhat general measurement for the robustness against light variations there are light paths generated for the following four image positions: 12 (arc 1), 25 (arc 1), 60 (linear path), and 87 (arc 2).
See \citet{aanaes2010recall,aanaes2010ground} for more information about the dataset and the generated light paths.

\Cref{fig:light_example} show 6 of the different light images for scene 4 at camera position 60. \Cref{fig:light_example_02,fig:light_example_17,fig:light_example_08} show the images taken with individual LED lighting (numbers 2, 17, and 8 respectively), and \Cref{fig:light_example_00} shows the diffuse light image. We here notice the significant difference in cast shadows using the three LEDs individually compared to the diffuse light image. The diffuse light image is however quite dark compared to the LED 8 light image, which could potentially cause problems in some scenes generating too few interest points. Such an issue could however be handled by adapting detection thresholds or by using histogram stretching/equalization.
\Cref{fig:light_example_28,fig:light_example_20} show the left- and rightmost positions of the X light path. By comparing these to their LED counterparts (\subref{fig:light_example_02} and \subref{fig:light_example_17} respectively) we see that the cast shadows are less significant therefore looking more natural.
\Cref{fig:viewpoint_example} shows 4 different camera positions for scene 4 including the keyframe (position 25)..

\subsection{Evaluation}
In order to be able to classify matches between two images $A$ and $B$ as true or false, we need an evaluation method. In other words we need to compute/generate the match ground truth. The DTU dataset has been scanned using \emph{structured light} generating point clouds for the surfaces in each image. Using these points and the known camera positions for each image we are able to check if a matching of two points from $A$ and $B$ indeed correspond to 3D points close enough to one another to be true. Sometimes a matching is made for an image position with no corresponding 3D point. In this case no ground truth can be calculated and the matching is ignored in the performance evaluation. The details of the evaluation method are described by \citet{larsen2012in}.
%
\subsection{Pitfalls and deficiencies}
The DTU dataset is built to test the ability of computer vision systems to cope with viewpoint changes, scaling, light changes, and to a certain extent occlusions as well. Since all images are captured with the same camera tilt, no rotation of objects occurs and hence rotational invariance and robustness cannot be evaluated using this dataset.

\Cref{fig:dtu_problems} shows the problems we have found within the DTU dataset, which we will go through here.

The artificial diffuse light is, as mentioned in the previous section, created by combining images captured under individual LED lighting. This is not optimal as some of the images are visually suffering from the spatial layout of the LED lights. \Cref{fig:dtu_problems_diffuse} shows image 20 (arc 1) from set 2 of the dataset. The diffuse light problem is clearly visible in the cast shadows seen on the 1st and 3rd book in the stack of lying books. Ideally these shadows would form either a smoothed or a single hard shadow edge instead of a number of gradually fading hard edges.

The automatic capturing of images using a robot arm combined with the individual LED lighting has the side-effect of the robot arm casting shadows in some of the images. This is seen when using the 3rd LED light and having captured the scenes from the far left of arc 1. \Cref{fig:dtu_problems_robot} shows an example of a cast shadow originating from the robot arm. This is however only a problem with one of the 19 LED light images and hence the effect on the final test images is minimal.
