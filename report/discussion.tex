\chapter{Discussion}

- Is it worth adding shape index?
- Importance of different parameters and design choices, relate these results to other articles
- Optimal parameters are very different for the two applications, hard to choose a good overall descriptor. Biggest differences: smooth, kernels, norm. scale, final descriptor normalization
- Considered using multi-scale descriptors as the galaxy descriptor, but it doesn't seem like a good idea
- Dimensionality of descriptors, worth using compact GO?
- Running time: we have not focused on running time, optionally run a profiler, where can we save time? (don't use MATLAB)
- Overall results and comparison of descriptor design with SIFT/HOG. SIFT: not much difference, HOG: we beat them by using a dense descriptor with pixel normalization instead of block normalization

\section{Parameter study}


\section{Future work} % rename to alternative approaches?
- Improved pixel normalization:
	- normalize by the area which we integrated over to avoid boundary conditions
	- Some way of removing noise from dark areas
- PCA to reduce dimensionality of GO+SI?
- Two-way matching could improve matching results, but not important for comparing descriptors
- Object detection could be evaluated on harder datasets, as we have almost perfect classification on INRIA
- Higher level descriptors using our descriptor for better object classification
- Higher (than 2) order differential information
- Computing histograms at original scales, causing infeasible computation time. Maybe possible to limit the size and get good results?
- Distribution of shape index is not uniform, maybe changing bin locations could help. Reference "Shape index 2009"
- Better parameter optimization approaches. Simulated annealing?
